- Technology used:
Figma to get the project references and guidelines
Visual Code Studio as coding editor to work on HTML, CSS and JS.
with HTML it has been created the structure of the 3 project's pages.
CSS has been used to give style to the 3 project's pages.
JS has been used to give the logic to validate the form on page 3 (Contac Us), also it has been used to page import data from back end for page 2 (Project Page).

- Features: 
  Validation form it has been done with separate function (one function for each field). Functions are made in conditional statement (IF, ELSE) and onblur event  in order to make sure that user fills all the fields before submitting the form (please see contactUs.html and contactUs.js)
  
  Responsiveness it has been made adding in CSS the min-width and the max-width properties especially when used flex. Also tried to calculate size in % 

  To create project page 2 it has been import data from back-end using a Fetch async function and JSON. (Please see projectPage.js)

- Backlog: Room of improvement CSS, Responiveness (add hamburger fold -out menu) and KISS.
